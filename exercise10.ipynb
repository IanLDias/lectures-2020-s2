    "1. Visualize the evolution of the employment states using an area plot  \n",
    "1. Compute the stationary distribution of employment states.  Verify that it coincides with the simulated invariant distribution.  \n",
    "1. Consider an initially unemployed worker.  Simulate employment states for this worker for $ N $ periods.  Compute the fractions of time the worker is in each state, and make a line plot of the three of these fraction with N on the horizontal axis.  Verify that the ergodicity of the invariant distribution.  \n",
